Docker Swarm vs. Standalone Docker: Your Terraform configuration is set up to deploy Docker services using the Docker provider. This configuration is suitable for deploying services to a Docker Swarm cluster. If you're using standalone Docker without Swarm, you may need to adjust the provider configuration accordingly.

Image Names: The image names you've used (app_image, db_image, web_image) should correspond to the actual names of the Docker images you've built or obtained. Ensure that these image names match the names used in your Docker Compose file or the images available in your Docker registry.

Network Configuration: The Docker network resource you've defined (docker_network.webapp_network) creates a Docker network named webapp_network, which your Docker services (app, db, web) are connected to. This ensures that the services can communicate with each other over this network.

Dependency Management: You've correctly specified dependencies between services using the depends_on attribute. This ensures that the app service starts only after the db service is up and running, as specified.

Host Address: The host attribute in the Docker provider configuration specifies the address of the Docker daemon. The value tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 indicates that Terraform communicates with the Docker daemon over TCP on localhost and port 2375. Make sure this matches the configuration of your Docker daemon.
